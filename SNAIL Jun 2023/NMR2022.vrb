\frametitle{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Work with stronger materialisation-based reasoning coverages (e.g. lexicographic, relevant);
  \item Study complexity of this reasoning procedure;
  \item Investigate the broader class of horn-DLs;
  \item Compare with other existing frameworks;
  \item Work on a set of KLM-like postulates that better capture quantification.
\end{itemize}
