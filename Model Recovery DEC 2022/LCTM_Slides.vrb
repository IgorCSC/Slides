\frametitle{The procedural approach -- Intuition}
A set of rules to deal with \emph{violations}.
Those violations are not only axiom violations, but also deal with interpretations that do not conform to the properties outlined in the semantic approach.

$\Jmc$ is an \emph{improvement over} $\Imc$ iff it is generated by applying one of the rules to $\Imc$.

A series $\Imc_1, \dots, \Imc_k$ fixes $\Imc_1$ iff $\Imc^{i}$ is an improvement over $\Imc^{i+1}$ and $\Imc^{k}$ contains no violation.
